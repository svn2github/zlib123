The Add-in setup programs (Word 2007, Word 2003 and Word XP) also require Visual Studio 2005.
To compile Word 2003 & Word XP Add-in setup programs, you will also need to patch Visual Studio, 
by following the instructions given at the following address: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/908002/en-us.

Notes
-----
To generate the OdfAddInForWordSetup project, you will have to copy the content of KB908002 and DotNetFX
folders (from the OdfForWordAddInSetup) folders to <.NET 2.0 Framework SDK Folder>\Bootstrapper\Packages folder
- OdfAddInForWordSetup/DotNetFX only contains localized strings , add these folders to the existing dotnetfx package folder
- OdfAddInForWordSetup/KB908002 only contains an updated product.xml and new tool which detects if the office patch has been installed
