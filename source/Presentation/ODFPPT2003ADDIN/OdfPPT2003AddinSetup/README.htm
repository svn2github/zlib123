<h1>ODF Add-in for PowerPoint 2003</h1>
Thank you for downloading the ODF Add-in PowerPoint 2003. The purpose of this software is to enable the user to open an ODF Specification based document in PowerPoint 2003 and demonstrate the interoperability between OpenXML and ODF specifications.<br>
<h2>Software Requirements</h2>
    Before installing ODF Add-In for PowerPoint make sure to install all the High- Priority
    updates from <a href="http://update.microsoft.com/windowsupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us"
        target="_blank">Microsoft Update</a>.
    <br />
    <br />
To test the add-in, you will need the following:<br>
 1. PowerPoint 2003<br>
 2. .NET Framework 2.0* & Shared add-in extensibility(KB908002)**<br>
 3. Compatibility Pack* for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats (beta 2 or higher).<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT NOTES:<br>
<br>
(*) Warning: If Microsoft PowerPoint is installed before .Net Framework, you need to update the PowerPoint by executing/ running the steps below.<br>
<br>
   1. From <strong>Control Panel </strong>Double-click <strong>Add/Remove Programs.</strong><br>
   2. In the list of currently installed programs find for <strong>Microsoft PowerPoint</strong>,
    choose <strong>Modify</strong>.<br>
   3. Within the installation process choose <strong>Add/Remove features</strong>,
    add <strong>.Net Programmability Support in Microsoft Office PowerPoint.</strong><br>
<br>
(**) Microsoft Shared Add-in Support Update(KB908002) is part of the add in set up.
<br />
<h2>Installing the add-in</h2>
    Follow the steps to install the downloaded program:<br>
<br>
    Once the installation is complete, you can notice that in the <strong>PowerPoint, File
        Menu</strong> a new menu item, <strong>Open ODF</strong> is added. It allows either importing the ODF PowerPoint file or exporting the current working document to an ODF PowerPoint file (<strong>Note:</strong> During the development process
    these functionalities may be temporarily unavailable).<br>
<br>
    <strong>
 Important note: </strong>An <strong>ODF</strong> file opened by the add-in is imported in <strong>Microsoft PowerPoint</strong> as a read-only PPTX file. However,
    if you want to save it back to <strong>ODF file</strong>, first make a copy of this
    document ("<strong>Menu&gt;Save As</strong>") and then use “<strong>Export as ODF</strong>".<br>
<br>
<h2>Troubleshooting Guide</h2>
If you don't see the <strong>ODF </strong>entry, it could be due to missing features in <strong>PowerPoint</strong> (see the Software Requirements listed above) or a failure during the installation of the Powerpoint Primary Interop Assemblies.
