<h1>ODF Add-in for PowerPoint2007</h1>
Thank you for downloading the ODF Add-in PowerPoint 2007. The purpose of this software is to enable the user to open an ODF Specification based document in PowerPoint 2007 and demonstrate the interoperability between Open XML and ODF specifications. Since, the Add-in is still a beta release; nevertheless you may use this to test
    it at your own risk! However, the feedback is welcome though!<br>
<br>
<h2>Software Requirements</h2>
To test the add-in, you will need the following:<br>
 1. PowerPoint 2007<br>
 2. .NET Framework 2.0*<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
<h2>Installing the add-in</h2>
    Follow the steps to install the downloaded program:<br>
<br>
    Once the installation is complete, you can notice that in the <strong>PowerPoint, File
        Menu</strong> a new menu item, <strong>Open ODF</strong> is added. It allows either importing the ODF PowerPoint file or exporting the current working document to an ODF PowerPoint file (<strong>Note:</strong> During the development process
    these functionalities may be temporarily unavailable).<br>
<br>
    <strong>
 Important note:</strong> An ODF file opened by the add-in is imported in 
    <strong>Microsoft PowerPoint</strong> as a read-only PPTX file. However, if you want to save it back to ODF file, first make a copy of this document ("<strong>Menu&gt;Save
        As</strong>") and then use “<strong>Export as ODF</strong>".<br>
<br>
<h2>Troubleshooting Guide</h2>
If you don't see the <strong>ODF </strong>entry, it could be due to missing features in <strong>PowerPoint</strong> (see the Software Requirements listed above). After completing the <strong>ODF Add-in</strong> installation,  you need to activate the 
    <strong>Add-in</strong> by doing the following actions:<br>
<br>
* On the <strong>File Menu</strong>, click <strong>PowerPoint Options</strong>.<br>
